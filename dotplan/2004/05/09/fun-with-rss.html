            <p><em>In which I write about experimenting with RSS.</em></p>
            <p>I've been reading up on RSS, specifically the 2.0 spec.  I think that I want to use it to pass data around my <a href="http://s89994741.onlinehome.us">new homepage</a>.  see, I'm building it from scratch, and have several modules that I want to be able to access easily from different parts of the page... like the bookmarks or news module from within the module, or from the front page.  plus, then it would be easy to access various bits from outside of my homepage... for example, I could subscribe to my list of left-handed chainsaw sites, and view it in an aggregator along with my news from slashdot, or whatever.  one stop surfing, really.</p>

            <p>of course, I don't want to have my homepage widgets having to communicate over port 80, since that would impact my bandwidth.  so, I'll need to have some functions in the modules that I can export to other php scripts, in order to nicely communicate <i>without</i> having to go off of the webserver.  makes sense, I think.</p>

            <p>(Yah know, you'd think that if you were trying to see 'everything' in the manage posts area, you'd be able to see ALL of your posts, including the drafts.  not terribly user friendly at all).</p>
