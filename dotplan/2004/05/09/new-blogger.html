            <p><em>In which I write about the new Blogger interface.</em></p>
            <p>I like the new blogger look and feel.</p>

            <p>it was a bit of a surprise when I logged in this evening, but things work very nicely. the "Edit Posts" area works as I expect it to now, meaning that I can see my draft posts when I view everything, and it's obvious which posts are such. plus, the colours are nice, too.</p>

            <p>the only thing that I really have to complain about is that I don't like the way it converts line breaks. it makes everything look all crappy. so, I turned them off and started doing manual line breaks.</p>

            <p>only problem was, I had to go back and fix all my old posts. luckily I only had a handful... :)</p>
