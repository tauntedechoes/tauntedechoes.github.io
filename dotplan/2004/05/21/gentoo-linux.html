            <p><em>In which I write about discovering Gentoo Linux.</em></p>

            <p>I've heard quite a bit about <a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo Linux</a> lately, so I thought that I'd give it a try on my box at work.  I decided to get the &quot;full&quot; Gentoo experience and compile everything, and take advantage of custom compiled binaries and whatnot.</p>

            <p>I started this on Tuesday.  I'm still at the stage 2 step of the installation, where it compiles up the system.  so, I don't know if I'm really qualified to review what I've seen so far, but here goes anyhow.</p>

            <p>based on the documentation, it seems as if the developers had read the <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/news.html">Linux From Scratch</a> documentation, and said &quot;Hey, this is neat.  But not everyone has the time to do EVERYTHING from scratch, so why don't we make up a new system that does some of it for them, while documenting the steps that one goes through?&quot;  I'm not very far along in the setup (just about to do the kernel compile), but I already feel like I have a better knowledge of  a linux system than before.  not alot, but some.  plus, I've used some utilities that I hadn't before.</p>

            <p>the documentation is also amongst the best of any open-source project I've seen.  it puts crap like what the <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/">Apache Cocoon Project</a> puts out to shame (a subject for another rant / post).  It's well organized, easy to read, and <b>easy to find information</b> that you need or are interested in.  It contains a plethora of information on sub-projects, also well organized, and projects that are outside the Gentoo developement circle, but are still relevant to the Gentoo project itself.</p>

            <p>I'm excited to see how this turns out.  hopefully, it will lead to a more easily maintainable machine.  or at least, something that I enjoy using, rather than <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">beating</a> <a href="http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en-us/">my</a> <a href="http://www.debian.org/">head</a> <a href="http://www.suse.com/us/">against</a>.</p>
